- Proper categorization and execution unit dispatch
- Cycle count determination per instruction

## Architecture Highlights

### Pipeline Structure
```
Issue → Dispatch → Execute (Variable Cycles) → Writeback
         ↓          ↓
      Hazard    Execution
      Check      Units
```

### Execution Units
1. **Adder**: Add, subtract, compare, convert (2 cycles)
2. **Multiplier**: Booth-3 recoded multiply (2-3 cycles)
3. **Divider**: SRT divide/sqrt (7-15 cycles)
4. **VCU**: Special value handling (1-2 cycles)
5. **Memory**: Load/store operations (2-3 cycles)
6. **Control**: Status/rounding updates (1 cycle)

### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ IEEE 754 single and double precision
- ✅ All 5 exception types (overflow, underflow, inexact, invalid, divide-by-zero)
- ✅ 4 rounding modes (nearest, zero, +∞, -∞)
- ✅ Denormal number support framework
- ✅ NaN and infinity handling via VCU
- ✅ Shadow registers for interrupt support
- ✅ Pipeline hazard detection
- ✅ Multi-cycle operation support

- Load/Store: 2-3 cycles depending on cache ✅

## Next Steps (Phase 3 & 4)

### Phase 3: Complete Instruction Implementation
- Connect all decoded instructions to execution units
- Implement remaining control instructions
- Add T805 compatibility mode operations
- Complete exception trap generation

### Phase 4: IEEE 754 Compliance Testing
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Validate all corner cases
- Performance benchmarking
- Integration testing with CPU pipeline

## Summary
In the 1-hour session, we successfully completed:
- All of Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)
- All of Phase 2 (Arithmetic Units)
- Created 8 new Scala files with ~3,000 lines of code
- Implemented the core FPU architecture matching T9000 specifications

The FPU implementation is now structurally complete with all major components in place. The remaining work involves connecting the pieces, implementing the remaining instructions, and thorough testing for IEEE 754 compliance.
